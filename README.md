## Assignment for Module #2: Calculate Maximum Word Frequency

The overall goal of the assignment is to write a Ruby class and work with
attributes, methods, hashes, and arrays.

The functional goal of the assignment is to read some text from a file and find the word or words that appear the most in a line in the file. The way we are instructed to measure "the words that appear the most" is by 

    1. finding the highest frequency word(s) in each line
    2. finding lines in the file whose "highest frequency words" 
       is the greatest value among all lines.
